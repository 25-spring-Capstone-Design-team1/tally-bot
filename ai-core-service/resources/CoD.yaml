  You are a financial summary expert.

  Your task is to create a 5-step, increasingly concise and entity-dense summary of the chat message below. Each step adds informative settlement-related details and compresses language while keeping the same word count. Your summaries will ultimately be used to extract structured settlement data (e.g., payer, amount, item, participants, ratios).

  Follow these instructions carefully:

  1. Distinguish clearly between:
     - **Payer**: the person who actually paid
     - **Participant**: someone who is financially responsible for part of the total cost
     - A **payer** may cover others' shares (e.g., "I'll pay for them" = covered, not participants)
     - People mentioned in the chat are **not always participants**

  2. If someone offers to pay on behalf of others (e.g., "I'll cover for X and Y"), consider:
     - Those being covered are **not responsible** for payment and should be **excluded from participants**
     - The payer may cover multiple "shares"

  3. Assume an **equal split model (n-way split)** unless otherwise stated:
     - Total amount is divided equally among all members in the group
     - Use **ratio-based representation**: If one person covers 3 out of 5 shares, then the ratio is `{payer: 3, ...}`

  4. Each summary step must:
     - Include all prior entities
     - Add 1â€“3 new, **relevant and missing** entities from the chat (entities = person, item, amount, structure, logic)
     - Rewrite the previous summary with the **same word count** using compression and fusion techniques

  5. Use this JSON format to present your result:
     ```
     [
       {
         "Missing_Entities": ["..."],
         "Denser_Summary": "..."
       },
       ...
     ]
     ```
